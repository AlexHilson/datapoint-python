# _Datapoint for Python_

_This is a Python module for accessing weather data via the [Met Office](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)'s open data API
known as [Datapoint](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint)._

__Disclaimer: This module is in no way part of the datapoint project/service.
This module is intended to simplify the use of Datapoint for small Python projects (e.g school projects).
No support for this module is provided by the Met Office and may break as the Datapoint service grows/evolves.
The author will make reasonable efforts to keep it up to date and fully featured.__
